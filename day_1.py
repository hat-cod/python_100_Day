# Python Day 1: Getting Started
# 1. Introduction to Python
# What is Python?

# Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language.
# It is known for its readability and simplicity, making it ideal for beginners.
# Installing Python

# Download and install Python from the official site: python.org.
# Ensure that the Python installation includes the pip package manager.
# Setting Up the IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

# For beginners, you can use IDEs like:
# IDLE (comes with Python installation)
# VSCode (Visual Studio Code)
# PyCharm
# Jupyter Notebooks for interactive coding
# 2. Writing Your First Python Program
# Open your IDE (IDLE, VSCode, etc.).
# Create a new Python file and write the following code:
# python
# Copy code
# Explanation: This is a basic Python program. print() is a built-in function that outputs text to the console.
# 3. Basic Python Concepts
# Variables and Data Types: Learn about variables and basic data types.

# Integer (int): a = 10
# Float (float): b = 3.14
# String (str): name = "Alice"
# Boolean (bool): is_active = True
# Basic Arithmetic Operations:

# python
# Copy code
print("Hello, World!")
a = 5
b = 3
print(a + b)  # Addition
print(a - b)  # Subtraction
print(a * b)  # Multiplication
print(a / b)  # Division
# Comments in Python:

# Comments are used to explain code and are ignored by the interpreter.
# Single-line comment: # This is a comment
# Multi-line comment:
# python
# Copy code
# """
# This is a 
# multi-line comment.
# """
# 4. Basic Input and Output
# Taking User Input:
# python
# Copy code
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello, " + name + "!")
# Explanation: input() gets input from the user and stores it in a variable.
# 5. Control Flow: Conditionals
# If-Else Statements:
# python
# Copy code
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
if age >= 18:
     print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")
# 6. Loops: Repeating Code
# For Loop:

# python
# Copy code
for i in range(5):
     print(i)
# This loop prints numbers from 0 to 4.
# While Loop:

# python
# Copy code
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
# Day 1 Summary
# Goal: Get familiar with Python's syntax, write simple programs, and understand how to perform basic operations like printing, input/output, conditionals, and loops.
